# Getting Stawted with Cweate weact App

This pwoject was bootstwapped with [Cweate weact App](https://github.com/facebook/cweate-weact-app).

## Available Scwipts

In the pwoject diwectowy, you can wun:

### `npm stawt`

wuns the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the bwowsew.

The page will weload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint ewwows in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test wunnew in the intewactive watch mode.\
See the section about [wunning tests](https://facebook.github.io/cweate-weact-app/docs/wunning-tests) fow mowe infowmation.

### `npm wun build`

Builds the app fow pwoduction to the `build` foldew.\
It cowwectly bundles weact in pwoduction mode and optimizes the build fow the best pewfowmance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Youw app is weady to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/cweate-weact-app/docs/deployment) fow mowe infowmation.

### `npm wun eject`

**Note: this is a one-way opewation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you awen’t satisfied with the build tool and configuwation choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will wemove the single build dependency fwom youw pwoject.

Instead, it will copy all the configuwation files and the twansitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) wight into youw pwoject so you have full contwol ovew them. All of the commands except `eject` will still wowk, but they will point to the copied scwipts so you can tweak them. At this point you’we on youw own.

You don’t have to evew use `eject`. The cuwated featuwe set is suitable fow small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this featuwe. Howevew we undewstand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you awe weady fow it.
